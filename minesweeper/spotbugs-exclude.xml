<!-- This file is a bit ridonculous, but we need it to exclude a specific bug (which isn't really a
bug) from the spotbugs report. 
    In short, it is the autowiring of HighscoreService in HighscoreRestController that spotbugs doesn't
like.
    We are excluding this bug, because we know that the autowiring is correct. -->
